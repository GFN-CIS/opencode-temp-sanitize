# opencode-temp-sanitize

OpenCode 2 plugin that gives each project its own temporary directory.

## Why

OpenCode tells every model to prefer `$TMPDIR/opencode` (usually `/tmp/opencode`) over
`/tmp` for scratch files, and pre-approves it for external access. All projects and
sessions share that one directory, so it grows without bound and nobody can tell which
project left what. On hosts where `/tmp` is a size- or quota-limited tmpfs this
eventually breaks unrelated programs.

## What it does

- Creates `/tmp/opencode/<slug>` for the current project, where `<slug>` is the project
  directory relative to `$HOME` with `/` replaced by `-`, plus the CRC32 of the OpenCode
  project id: `~/work/example-app` becomes `work-example-app-1a2b3c4d`. Sessions outside
  any project use `global`.
- Rewrites the core temporary-directory hint in the system prompt to point at that
  directory. It stays inside the pre-approved tree, so no new permission prompts.
- Sets `TMPDIR` to the same directory for shell commands the agent runs.

Models treat the hint as advice; nothing prevents them from writing elsewhere.
The plugin does not delete anything yet.

## Install

Add to the `plugins` array in `opencode.json`, pinned to a tag:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["opencode-temp-sanitize@git+https://github.com/GFN-CIS/opencode-temp-sanitize.git#v0.1.0"]
}
```

Requires OpenCode 2.

## Upstream dependency

The rewrite matches the exact sentence emitted by OpenCode core in
`packages/core/src/instructions/builtins.ts` (`core/environment`, verified at v2.2.6),
and assumes the shared directory is `path.join(os.tmpdir(), "opencode")` as in
`packages/util/src/global-roots.ts`. If upstream changes the wording, the plugin logs
`[temp-sanitize] tmp hint not found` once per session and models fall back to the shared
directory. `tests/project-tmp.test.js` pins the sentence.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run coverage   # vitest, 80% thresholds
npm run lint       # biome
npm run knip
```

Logic lives in `src/project-tmp.js`; `index.js` only wires OpenCode hooks.
